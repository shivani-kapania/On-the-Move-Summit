<p>This workshop will bring together transport workers, labor organizers, technologists, and policymakers to confront the expanding role of AI and automation in the transit, taxi, and logistics sectors. As algorithmic systems increasingly shape working conditions, surveillance, and decision-making on the job, this gathering aims to build shared understanding and strategic capacity across sectors. Through sector updates and breakout strategy sessions, participants will assess emerging AI-related harms and co-develop actionable approaches for governing these technologies in ways that uphold worker rights, safety, and autonomy.</p>

<p>The event is being facilitated by Sarah Fox (Carnegie Mellon University), Lilly Irani (University of California, San Diego), and Nantina Vgontzas (City University of New York), with support from the National Science Foundationâ€™s Responsible Design, Development, and Deployment of Technologies program.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>AI Recommendations / Transport Workers AI Bill of Rights</li>
  <li>Strategies for coordinated safety actions</li>
  <li>Tool for collective evidence of AI-related harms</li>
  <li>Shared language for talking about AI issues across the industry</li>
</ul>
